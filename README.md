# Fractal Generator

An interactive fractal generator built with React, TypeScript, and styled-components. This project allows users to create and customize beautiful fractal patterns in real-time.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed in collaboration with AI, specifically using Codeium's Windsurf IDE with its AI agent Cascade. The development process was a human-AI collaboration where:

- Initial project structure and core functionality were co-created with AI
- Code reviews and refactoring suggestions were provided by AI
- Documentation was generated with AI assistance
- Docker configuration was set up with AI guidance

I believe in transparency about AI usage in development, as it represents a modern approach to software engineering that combines human creativity with AI capabilities.
